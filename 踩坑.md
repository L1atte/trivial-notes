Object spread also has a couple of other surprising limits. First, it only includes an objects’ [own, enumerable properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Enumerability_and_ownership_of_properties). Basically, that means you lose methods when you spread instances of an object:

```javascript
class C {
  p = 12;
  m() {}
}
let c = new C();
let clone = { ...c };
clone.p; // ok
clone.m(); // error!
```
